# Dungeon Dwellers Beta

## Introduction
Welcome to the Dungeon Dwellers Beta GitHub page. This page serves two purposes:

1. A place for people to download test builds of my game
2. A place for people to report bugs found in my game

I provide one simple guarantee:
* These builds are guaranteed to be **_completely unstable_**.

That means any progress made in these builds could become irrelevant by the next release.

## What is Dungeon Dwellers?
Dungeon Dwellers is a small game that revolves around two keys places:

1. The Dungeon
2. The Hub

The Dungeon is exactly what it sounds like; A dungeon for you to roam around, loot, and kill things.
The Hub is where you collect resources, create items, and gear up for the Dungeon.

**THERE IS CURRENTLY NO TUTORIAL!!!**
It's the next thing to be rebuilt, so it should be done soon. _Hopefully_.

## How do I become a Beta Tester?
Since this is an open beta, just download a release file and start playing.
If you find any problems (Typos, gliches, crashes, etc.), report them by creating an Issue.
If you have a recommendation (Balancing, visual or functional changes, etc.), you can make suggestions by creating an Issue.

## What recommendations can I make?
Literally any. If you hate how the mining system works, leave a suggestion. If you hate the visuals, let me know.
There is no feedback I won't accept, and there are very few things I won't consider.

I only ask if you do leave a suggestion, be nice about it. I've spent 2 years making this game, so

## Future Plans
I hope to release this game on all mobile and PC platforms through official channels (App Store, Google Play, Steam, etc.), but
I need this game to be better than it is.
