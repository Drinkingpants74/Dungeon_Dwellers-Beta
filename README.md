# Dungeon Dwellers Beta

## Introduction
Welcome to the Dungeon Dwellers Beta GitHub page. This page serves two purposes:

1. A place for people to test run my game
2. A place for people to report bugs found in my game

## What is Dungeon Dwellers
Dungeon Dwellers is a small game that revolves around two keys places:

1. The Dungeon
2. The Hub

The Dungeon is exactly what it sounds like; A dungeon for you to roam around, loot, and kill things.
The Hub is where you collect resources, create items, and gear up for the Dungeon.
