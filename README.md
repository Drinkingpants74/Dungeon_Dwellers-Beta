## What Is Dungeon Dwellers?

Dungeon Dwellers is a Dungeon Crawler with RPG elements. You will create a player, fight monsters and craft gear.
You will earn experience to level up both combat and non-combat skills such as Attack, Defense, Smithing, and Mining, just to name a few.


## What Is The Beta?

The Beta is the full game as it stands right now. Every feature, along with every bug. That's why this page exists; Testing.
By downloading a build, you will have access to the full game, with all it's features. You can find a build for your device on the
[releases page](https://github.com/Drinkingpants74/Dungeon_Dwellers-Beta/releases).


## How Can You Help?

Play the game. I need as many eyes on this project as possible so I can work towards an official release.
When you find a bug, please create an issue, and follow the rules in the [Bug Reporting and Suggestions](https://github.com/Drinkingpants74/Dungeon_Dwellers-Beta/edit/main/README.md#bug-reporting-and-suggestions) section below.


## Bug Reporting and Suggestions
If you find a bug or just have a suggestion, you can create an issue. Before making a new issue _PLEASE LOOK FOR IT FIRST_!
It's possible someone else has already made a bug report, or put in the suggestion. If you see your bug or suggestion already, you can do one of two things:

* Add Context
* Simply Type +1

Either option works just fine, and both let me know that others are having this issue, or would like he suggestion.
__IF YOU FIND YOUR SUGGESTION UNDER THE CLOSED SECTION DO NOT MAKE A NEW POST__!
If it was closed and not added, there was most likely a reason.

When making a bug report or suggestion, please use the following template:

* __TYPE:__ _Bug Report_ or _Suggestion_
* __DEVICE TYPE:__ _Mobile_ or _Computer_
* __DEVICE OS:__ _Android_, _MacOS_, _etc._
* __DESCRIPTION:__ _Please Don't Write Me an Essay_
