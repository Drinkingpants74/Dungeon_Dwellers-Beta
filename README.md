## What Is The Beta?

The Beta is the full game is it stands right now. Every feature, every bug, and everything that needs to change. That's why this page exists; Testing.
By downloading a build, you will have access to the full game, with all it's features. You can find a build for your device on the
[releases page](https://github.com/Drinkingpants74/Dungeon_Dwellers-Beta/releases).

The list below are things that I'm already working on. Some of these items just need to get some finishing touches, others need to be rebuilt.
* Tutorial - This is Priority #1 at the moment.
* Boss Dungeons - They exist, but they aren't finalized. All the dungeons are built, but some enemies need finalizing and animations.
* Music/SFX - I'm still working on adding more Music and SFX. Some scenes have Music and some actions have SFX, but not all.
* Parity - The Woodcutting mechanic will be changed to match Mining, and Smithing layout will be changed to match Crafting.


## How Can You Help?

Play the game. The more people who play this game, the more bugs can be found, and the more suggestions can be made. If you find a bug or think of a good idea for the game, create an issue following the rules in the [Bug Reporting and Suggestions](https://github.com/Drinkingpants74/Dungeon_Dwellers-Beta/edit/main/README.md#bug-reporting-and-suggestions) section below.


## Bug Reporting and Suggestions:
If you find a bug or just have a suggestion, you can create an issue. Before making a new issue _PLEASE SEARCH FOR IT FIRST_!
It's possible someone else has already made a bug report, or put in the suggestion. If you see your bug or suggestion already, you can do one of two things:

* Add Context
* Simply Type +1

Either option works just fine, and both let me know that others are having this issue, or like the suggestion.
__IF YOU FIND YOUR SUGGESTION UNDER THE CLOSED SECTION DO NOT MAKE A NEW POST__!
If it was closed and not added, there was most likely a reason.

When making a bug report or suggestion, please use the following template:

* __TYPE:__ _Bug Report_ or _Suggestion_
* __DEVICE TYPE:__ _Mobile_ or _Computer_
* __DEVICE OS:__ _Android_, _Linux(Fedora)_, _etc._
* __DESCRIPTION:__ _Please Don't Write Me an Essay_
* __STEPS TO REPLICATE:__ _Only If Reporting A Bug_
* Anything Else


## Potentially Asked Questions:

### Do I _Have_ To Report Bugs?
No. If you just want to play this game, that's completely acceptable.
However, I would really appreciate any and all bug reports.

### When Will _<Insert Device/Arch/OS>_ Be Supported?
I plan to support both 64-Bit and ARM devices across most Operating Systems; Windows, MacOS, Linux, iOS, iPadOS, Android.

Currently, 64-Bit Windows and Linux builds are available, along with Android APKs.

Apple Products aren't currently supported. This is simply because I'm not paying the Developer Fee yet.
Eventually that will change, but for now; Apple Devices are Not Supported. Which I find odd since I built
the entire game on a MacBook Air.

### My Issue Was Closed, But The Bug Still Exists:
Just comment on the original issue letting me know it's still a problem.

### I Have A Similar Suggestion To A Closed One:
Depending on how similar they are you can do one of two things:
* Near Identical Suggestion - Just Comment on the Closed Issue _(Don't worry, I'll see it)_
* Somewhat Similar Suggestion - Create a new Issue

### When Is The Official Release?
I have no idea, and I'm not even going to attempt a guess.

### Hey Dev! These Graphics Suck!
Well that's simply because I have the artistic ability of a drunken squirrel high on crack.
And since I'm the sole developer, and don't exactly have the means to higher an artist, here we are.

Jokes aside, these images were a lot of effort on my part. There isn't a single image in the game that
wasn't scrutinized down to the last pixel (literally). So they may be ugly, but they could have been worse.
