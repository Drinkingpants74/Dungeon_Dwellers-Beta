## What Is The Beta?

The Beta is the full game is it stands right now. Every feature, every bug, and everything that needs to change. That's why this page exists; Testing.

[releases page](https://github.com/Drinkingpants74/Dungeon_Dwellers-Beta/releases).


## How Can You Help?

Play the game. The more people who play this game, the more bugs can be found, and the more suggestions can be made. If you find a bug or think of a good idea for the game, create an issue following the rules in the [Bug Reporting and Suggestions](https://github.com/Drinkingpants74/Dungeon_Dwellers-Beta/edit/main/README.md#bug-reporting-and-suggestions) section below.


## Bug Reporting and Suggestions:
If you find a bug or just have a suggestion, you can create an issue. Before making a new issue _PLEASE SEARCH FOR IT FIRST_!
It's possible someone else has already made a bug report, or put in the suggestion. If you see your bug or suggestion already, you can do one of two things:

* Add Context
* Simply Type +1

Either option works just fine, and both let me know that others are having this issue, or like the suggestion.
__IF YOU FIND YOUR SUGGESTION UNDER THE CLOSED SECTION DO NOT MAKE A NEW POST__!
If it was closed and not added, there was most likely a reason.

When making a bug report or suggestion, please use the following template:

* __TYPE:__ _Bug Report_ or _Suggestion_
* __DEVICE TYPE:__ _Mobile_ or _Computer_
* __DEVICE OS:__ _Android_, _MacOS_, _etc._
* __DESCRIPTION:__ _Please Don't Write Me an Essay_
* __STEPS TO REPLICATE:__ _Only If Reporting A Bug_
* Anything Else


## Potentially Asked Questions:

### Do I _Have_ To Report Bugs?
No. If you just want to play this game, that's completely acceptable.
However, I would really appreciate any and all bug reports.

### When Will Apple Devices Be Supported?
Currently, Apple Products aren't supported. This isn't because I don't like Apple, it's because I can't afford the $99 Developer Fee.
Hopefully that will change one day, but for the now; Apple Devices Are Not Supported. Which I find weird considering the entire game
was developed on a Macbook Air.

### My Issue Was Closed, But The Bug Still Exists:
Just comment on the original issue letting me know it's still a problem.

### I Have A Similar Suggestion To A Closed One:
If this is the case, you can either comment on the original suggestion with your variation,
or you can create a new issue.

### When Is The Official Release?
I have no idea, and I'm not even going to attempt a guess.
