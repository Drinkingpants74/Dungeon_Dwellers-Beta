## What Is The Beta?

The Beta is the full game is it stands right now. Every feature, every bug, and everything that needs to change. That's why this page exists; Testing.
By downloading a build, you will have access to the full game, with all it's features. You can find a build for your device on the
[releases page](https://github.com/Drinkingpants74/Dungeon_Dwellers-Beta/releases).

The list below are things that I'm already working on. Some of these items just need to get some finishing touches, others need to be rebuilt.
* Tutorial - This is Priority #1 at the moment.
* Boss Dungeons - They exist, but they aren't finalized. All the dungeons are built, but some enemies need finalizing and animations.
* Music/SFX - I'm still working on adding more Music and SFX. Some scenes have Music and some actions have SFX, but not all.
* Parity - The Woodcutting mechanic will be changed to match Mining, and Smithing layout will be changed to match Crafting.


## How Can You Help?

Play the game. The more people who play this game, the more bugs can be found, and the more suggestions can be made. If you find a bug or think of a good idea for the game, create an issue following the rules in the [Bug Reporting and Suggestions](https://github.com/Drinkingpants74/Dungeon_Dwellers-Beta/edit/main/README.md#bug-reporting-and-suggestions) section below.


## Bug Reporting and Suggestions:
If you find a bug or just have a suggestion, you can create an issue. Before making a new issue _PLEASE SEARCH FOR IT FIRST_!
It's possible someone else has already made a bug report, or put in the suggestion. If you see your bug or suggestion already, you can do one of two things:

* Add Context
* Simply Type +1

Either option works just fine, and both let me know that others are having this issue, or like the suggestion.
__IF YOU FIND YOUR SUGGESTION UNDER THE CLOSED SECTION DO NOT MAKE A NEW POST__!
If it was closed and not added, there was most likely a reason.

When making a bug report or suggestion, please use the following template:

* __TYPE:__ _Bug Report_ or _Suggestion_
* __DEVICE TYPE:__ _Mobile_ or _Computer_
* __DEVICE OS:__ _Android_, _Linux(Fedora)_, _etc._
* __DESCRIPTION:__ _Please Don't Write Me an Essay_
* __STEPS TO REPLICATE:__ _Only If Reporting A Bug_
* Anything Else


## Potentially Asked Questions:

### Do I _Have_ To Report Bugs?
No. If you just want to play this game, that's completely acceptable.
However, I would really appreciate any and all bug reports.

### When Will _<Insert Device/Arch/OS>_ Be Supported?
I plan to support both 64-Bit and ARM devices running every major OS; Windows, MacOS, Linux, iOS, iPadOS, Android.

Currently, only 64-Bit Windows and Linux builds are available.

Apple Products aren't currently supported. This is simply because I can't afford the $99 Developer Fee.
Eventually that will change, but for now; Apple Devices are Not Supported. Which I find odd since I built
the entire game on a MacBook Air.

Android is not supported currently either, but that will be coming very soon.

### My Issue Was Closed, But The Bug Still Exists:
Just comment on the original issue letting me know it's still a problem.

### I Have A Similar Suggestion To A Closed One:
Depending on how similar they are you can do one of two things:
* Near Identical Suggestion - Just Comment on the Closed Issue _(Don't worry, I'll see it)_
* Somewhat Similar Suggestion - Create a new Issue

### When Is The Official Release?
I have no idea, and I'm not even going to attempt a guess.

### Hey Dev! These Graphics Suck!
Well that's simply because I have the artistic ability of a drunken squirrel high on crack.
And since I'm the sole developer, and don't exactly have the means to higher an artist, here we are.

Jokes aside, these images were a lot of effort on my part. There isn't a single image in the game that
wasn't scrutinized down to the last pixel (literally). So they may be ugly, but they could have been worse.
