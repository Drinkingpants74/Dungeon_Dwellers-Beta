# Dungeon Dwellers Beta

Welcome to the Open Beta of Dungeon Dwellers! Whether you're a returning tester, a new addition, or just stumbled onto this page randomly,
thank you for stopping by.

## The Skinny Of It
I need testers. I know too much about this game, so I need people who don't know anything to come yell at me. (Please don't actually yell).

While testing, please report **_ANY AND ALL_** bugs you find or suggestions you think of. If you want to know more about reporting bugs and suggestions [click here](https://github.com/Drinkingpants74/Dungeon_Dwellers-Beta/tree/main#bug-reporting-and-suggestions)
